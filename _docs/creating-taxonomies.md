title: Creating a taxonomy
---

Creating a custom taxonomy is done via UI with our free MB Custom Post Types & Custom Taxonomies extension. This extension is already bundled in Meta Box AIO/MB Core, or you can install it from [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mb-custom-post-type/).

To create a new custom taxonomy, go to **Meta Box &rarr; Taxonomies** and click **Add New**:

The settings are divided into 4 tabs:

- General: the taxonomy names and slug
- Labels: all labels for the taxonomy
- Advanced: advanced settings for the taxonomy such as public, menu settings, hierarchy, etc.
- Post types: the post types that connect to the taxonomy

After done, click **Publish** button to register the taxonomy. Or click the **Get PHP Code** button to get the PHP code that you can insert into your theme's `functions.php` file (or your plugin's file). After inserting, you can deactivate the extension to make your site a little bit faster.
